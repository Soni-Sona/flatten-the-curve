# Flatten the Curve

## Description

This project is an online presentation with interactive slides that teaches you what is the SIR model. It lets you play with its parameters, which is the best way to understand it. The SIR model is extended to show the effect of individual or global initiative on the evolution of an epidemic.

The presentation is divided into three parts. The first one defines the concept of _the Curve_ of Infected people over time. The second one shows several ways to decrease the height of _the Curve_, and the last part explains why this is important.

Finally, the user can play with the full interactive model to understand the (simplified) mechanics of disease propagation.

This project was made during the LauzHack Against COVID-19 Hackaton in April 2020.
